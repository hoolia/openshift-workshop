During this workshop you will be using a hosted version of the [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/). This is a commercially supported distribution of Kubernetes from Red Hat. The platform is also available as open source, in the form of [OKD](https://www.okd.io/), the Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes that powers Red Hat OpenShift.

Built around a core of OCI container packaging and Kubernetes container cluster management, OKD and OpenShift are augmented with additional application lifecycle management functionality and DevOps tooling. The platform provides a complete developer centric container application platform, which encompasses the original Container as a Service (CaaS) functionality of Kubernetes, along with Platform as a Service (PaaS) functionality.

Although OpenShift provides additional features on top of Kubernetes to make it easier to use, in this workshop we will be focusing on just the Kubernetes parts. Any concepts you learn in this workshop should be equally applicable to any other Kubernetes distribution, be it hosted by a service provider, or installed on your own hosts.

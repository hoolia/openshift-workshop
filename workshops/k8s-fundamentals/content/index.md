The [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) web site describes Kubernetes as:

> an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

This workshop is intended to give you a quick hands on introduction with using Kubernetes. In the process you will learn about some of the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes when deploying applications to it. The focus will be on what a developer would need to know to use the platform. It is not a workshop on how to run the Kubernetes platform.
